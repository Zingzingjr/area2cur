# area2cur
A program that finds the area between two curves for the TI-89/92/Voyage 200

Simply download this program to your calculator and run it, it's that simple.

Note that the 68k line of calculators use a propietary text encoding format so viewing with a standard text editor may not function properly, I reccomend using TI-Edit for viewing and editing code for this line. (http://tiedit.free.fr/index.php?lang=en)
